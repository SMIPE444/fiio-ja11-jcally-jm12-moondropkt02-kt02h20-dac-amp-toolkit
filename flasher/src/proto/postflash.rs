//! Post-reset reprobe: deciding whether a flash actually *worked*.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! ROADMAP Phase 3.4 — *"journal each stage before its destructive command **and confirm
//! success by a post-reset reprobe**"*. The first half landed with
//! [`crate::proto::ktcdc_journal`]; this is the second.
//!
//! Without it, a journal tops out at [`Stage::ResetIssued`](crate::proto::journal::Stage), whose
//! recovery action is `WaitAndReprobe` — i.e. "we sent RESET and then stopped paying attention".
//! `ktflash recover` can never say *done*, and a flash that reset into a non-booting image looks
//! exactly like one that worked.
//!
//! ## Deliberately conservative
//!
//! Two rules that matter more than they look:
//!
//! 1. **An ISP-mode device anywhere on the bus means "not confirmed."** If `8888:cdc0` is still
//!    present we report [`ReprobeOutcome::StillInBootloader`] even if some other runtime dongle
//!    is also attached. Claiming success while a device sits in the bootloader is the one wrong
//!    answer here: it tells the operator to walk away from a dongle that needs reflashing.
//! 2. **Identity mismatch is only ever reported against an explicit expectation.**
//!    [`Stage::IdentityMismatch`](crate::proto::journal::Stage) is a *halt* state that tells a
//!    human to preserve evidence and stop. Inferring an expected VID:PID and then halting on it
//!    would manufacture alarm from a guess, so a mismatch requires the caller to have said what
//!    it expected (`--expect`).
//!
//! This module is transport- and hardware-free: callers observe the bus and hand the result to
//! [`decide`], so the policy is unit-testable and the I/O stays in `main.rs`.
